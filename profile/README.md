- 👬Yes, we are building an Intel enthusiast community where individuals join to learn more about Intel Technologies, tools and Programs. 
- 📅 In fact, we’ve been doing this since **January 9th, 2022**. That's when we made and finalised our team. 
- 🏆 Since then we have conducted an event on **January 14th, 2022**, attended by roughly over **110 students** 🤯. But that's just us. 
- 💡 We are proud to be part of the Intel Team as Student Ambassador and Core team members. 
- 🤩 We are highly excited and enthusiastic to conduct more events, informative sessions, hackathons, competitions, & fun tasks🪐. 
- 😊 Yes, [Is that enough?](https://github.com/Intel-Student-Ambassadors/) - probably for now Yes!!
